There are a couple of good Python libraries for generating QR codes. Here are two popular options:

* **qrcode:** This is a well-established library that offers a simple and straightforward approach to QR code generation. It supports various functionalities like:
  * Specifying the data to encode (text, URL, etc.)
  * Error correction levels for data redundancy
  * QR code size and appearance customization (limited)
  * Saving the QR code as an image (PNG or SVG)

Here's a point to note: While qrcode was once a popular choice, it hasn't seen updates in recent years.

* **segno:** This is a more recent library that offers a wider range of features compared to qrcode. It provides functionalities like:
  * All features of qrcode
  * More customization options for QR code appearance (colors, logos, etc.)
  * Artistic QR code generation (backgrounds, rotations)

Here's a helpful tip: If you need basic QR code generation, qrcode might be sufficient. But, if you require more customization or a modern library, segno is a recommended choice.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install qrcode
# or
pip install segno
```
